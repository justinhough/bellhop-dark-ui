# Bellop Dark UI theme

A custom dark UI theme for Atom.

This theme can be activated by going to downloading it from the Atom Theme directory, then by going to the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the _UI Themes_ drop-down menu.

**Note:** The syntax colors are independent of the UI theme.
